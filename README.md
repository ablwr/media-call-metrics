# media-call-metrics

Small proof-of-concept app for collecting and visualizing video stream metadata.

## User goals

Public user goals:
- [ ] can create a video conference room
- [ ] can send video conference link to friends
- [ ] more than one user can do this at a time (conference IDs are generated and unique, not everyone joining the same room -- that's awkward)

Administrator user goals:
- [ ] can see dashboard with call history
- [ ] can click on each call to see call details
- [ ] call details should include visualized charts for received/sent bits per second and received/sent packet loss
- [ ] data should be at 15s granularity level

## Development
